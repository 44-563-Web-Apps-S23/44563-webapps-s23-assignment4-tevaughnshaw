        <pre>

<h4>MRS. BAUER.</h4> 
<p>No, Mr. Bauer's out yet. </p>
    <p>[_She listens through the transmitter._]</p> 
    <p>Thank you, Mrs. Mohler.</p> 
    <p>[_Another pause._]</p> 
    <p>I'll tell him just so soon he comes in--yes, ma'am.</p>

     <p>[MRS. BAUER _goes back to her ironing. Grocer boy rushes into
     basement, whistling; he puts down his basket, goes up to_ MRS.
     BAUER'S _door and looks in_.</p>


<h4>LANE.</h4> 
<p>Say--where's the boss?</p>

<h4>MRS. BAUER.</h4> 
<p>He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?</p>

     <p>[_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._</p>

<h4>LANE.</h4> 
<p>Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
groceries for Sawyers.</p>

<h4>MRS. BAUER.</h4> 
<p>[_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
which hangs beside the door._]</p>
<p> Here.</p>

<h4>LANE.</h4> 
<p>What's the matter?</p>

<h4>MRS. BAUER.</h4>
<p>[_Dully._]</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
